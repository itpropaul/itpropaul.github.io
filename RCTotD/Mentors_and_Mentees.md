### Surround yourself with mentors and mentees

Oftentimes I wish our industry was more like the trades where we would have apprenticeships. Finding yourself mentors and mentees is a close alternative and a way that you can "bootstrap" that process yourself.

You may think: "Yeah I get why I need mentors to learn and grow in this field, but why do I need to mentor others?" When you teach others, it forces you to learn what you're teaching at a deeper level and you become more adept at that topic yourself. As a bonus, the saying, "it's better to give than to receive" also rings true.
