### Identify Burnout and Take Action

If you enjoy this line of work to the point where you could do it night and day (and oftentimes do), that's awesome! But if you find that it's not fun anymore, that you're getting fatigued, or that you're overly irritable: It's OKAY to back off the intensity for a season. 

Spend more time physically or virtually with friends and family  
Get back to hobbies you enjoy  
Play games  
Binge watch TV shows  
Go outside  
Read a non-security book  
Evaluate if youâ€™re on the right trajectory for where you want to go with your career  
Find ways to serve through volunteering or just generally helping others around you  
Give to causes you believe in  
Exercise  
Challenge yourself with eating healthier  
See what a full 8 hours of sleep feels like  

Burnout is real. See the warning signs ahead of time and take action. You may find that some of the above ways to fight off burnout are net positives in your life no matter what season you find yourself in.
