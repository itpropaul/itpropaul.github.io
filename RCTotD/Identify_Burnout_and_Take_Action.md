### Identify Burnout and Take Action

If you enjoy this line of work to the point where you could do it night and day (and oftentimes do), that's awesome! But if you find that it's not fun anymore, that you're getting fatigued, or that you're overly irritable: It's OKAY to pump the brakes and back off the intensity for a season. Spend more time physically or virtually with friends and family, get back to hobbies you enjoy, play games, binge watch TV shows, go outside, read a non-security book, evaluate if you're on the right trajectory for where you want to go with your career, find ways to serve through volunteering or just generally helping others around you, give to causes you believe in, exercise, challenge yourself with eating healthier, see what a full 8 hours of sleep feels like.

Burnout is real. See the warning signs ahead of time and take action. You may find that some of the above ways to fight off burnout are net positives in your life no matter what season you find yourself in.
