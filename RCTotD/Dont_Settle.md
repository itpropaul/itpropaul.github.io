### Don't settle.

A large part of being in Cybersecurity as a defender is asking questions that will ultimately allow you to answer whether something is malicious or not. Oftentimes, you'll want to answer a question that you just don't have the answer to as you can't seem to find it or you're not collecting that data.

Don't settle.

Restlessly try to answer your questions. You may end up with more questions by trying to find the answer you're looking for, but that's okay, you'll learn along the way and be better prepared next time you find yourself in a similar situation. You may find where you needed to be looking or you may even implement additional logging to capture the needed data going forward.

Answer your questions and pursue your innate curiosity.

Don't settle.
