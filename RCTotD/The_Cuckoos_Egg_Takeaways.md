I just finished "The Cuckoo's Egg" by Clifford Stoll.

Here are some thoughts and takeaways:
- I listened to Clifford describe how perfect a supply chain attack would be in his book from over 30 years ago while the news of Sunburst was unfolding that day.
	- Don't think that you can't learn about Cybersecurity from resources that are over a few years old. This book is a classic for a reason. Yes the operating systems and software have been updated to an extent, but many tactics and techniques employed by attackers and defenders remain the same.
- A recurring theme in this book is Clifford's logbook. Clifford had predecessors that had made similar observations of things going awry in their networks, but one of the big differentiators was that Clifford took detailed notes. 
	- In Clifford's case the notes in his logbook spanned almost a year for a single investigation, but taking detailed notes during an investigation that lasts a few hours is just as important to keep the facts straight as well as for conveying what happened to others.
- Clifford frequently collaborated with co-workers, sysadmins from other organizations, even friends and family.
  - Don't underestimate the power of community. Don't live in a silo. We can accomplish so much more together than we can individually. 
- Clifford was persistent. He didn't give up on this investigation until he got the answers he was looking for.
	- Don't Settle. Answer your questions and pursue your innate curiosity. For more on this one, see <https://paul-masek.com/RCTotD/Dont_Settle>. This is a post I wrote while reading this book and was inspired by it.
- Clifford leveraged other areas of expertise in his investigation, such as physics, to determine the approximate distance to the hacker from him.
	- Be resourceful! All of us have experiences beyond Cybersecurity and some of us have spent the majority of our careers in fields other than Cybersecurity or even IT, use that to your advantage. Draw on your knowledge and experience holistically and apply it to Cybersecurity.
