### Thoughts on the SANS SEC401 "Security Essentials" course, earning a 92% on the GIAC GSEC exam, and subsequently getting invited to the GIAC Advisory Board (score 90% or above).

>I'm going to preface this whole post by being real and saying that my brain is not a steel trap. I have to work harder when it comes to memorization and gaining actionable knowledge than most. That's something that I've come to accept and don't let get in my way of achieving goals. I also struggle with staying focused and when it comes to studying for a potential 5 hour exam with a potential 180 DIFFICULT questions, I had to constantly reign in my focus to stay on task during my carved out study times and even then I failed A LOT and went down rabbit holes all too often.

### Course Format: 
I went with the OnDemand course. This was best for me, because I knew going at my own pace would allow me to absorb the material as much as possible.

### Deadline: 
It's a good thing that the course and certification exam had a deadline. I work best with deadlines whether forced or self-imposed. It gives me a target and the ability to see how I'm pacing as I go. For OnDemand and the certification exam, it's 4 months. I used every bit of this 4 months to absorb as much of the material as I could.

### Schedule: 
This is something that's extremely personal to every individual, so what worked for me won't necessarily be appropriate or work for you. I'm not naturally a morning person, but I found that the best time of day for me to study was in the mornings before my shift started. There were definitely exceptions but in general, I studied from 6:30-8 AM. I would also, when I had enough mental capacity that day, study during my lunch break, during my commute for a total of an hour a weekday, and in the last 2 months from 5-8pm one weekday evening. So ideally this allotted me 18 hours of study time a week. Real world, see note on struggling with focus, I probably got in 13 hours of concentrated study time a week. This equates to a total of roughly 220 hours of study time.

### Study Materials: 
This again is highly personal. One of the things I like about SANS training and the OnDemand format is you get the course in 3 formats: video, audio, and thousdands of pages worth of books broken into a book for each day of the course plus a workbook for labs. I say it's personal because based on your preferred learning style you can focus on the lectures or the books as your primary means to learn the material and supplement with the other two formats. Personally I went through the video course at a very methodical pace where I would stop whenever I wasn't familiar with a given concept, re-watch if needed or do some on the side learning, then come back and continue. I took this course and exam mainly for the knowledge-gain, so I wanted to get as much out of it as possible. During my normal commute, I was able to complete the audio lectures and listen to the first day's worth of audio a second time. Regarding the books themselves, I spent a lot of time creating a tabbed index on the pages and correlating that with a color-coded (by book and section of the book) index. For more on this see: <https://tisiphone.net/2015/08/18/giac-testing/>. I slightly modified Lesley's methodology and actually left the rows in book and page order like a Table of Contents as opposed to sorting them alphabetically and creating a normal index. Even though they weren't alphabetically ordered, having spent so much time in the material, I usually had a rough idea of where something was. If I did it again, I would print it both ordered by book and page number as well as alphabetically.

Regarding reigning in focus during study time, I used a combination of the following: do not disturb on my phone, close all applications besides the browser on my computer, pomodoro browser extension, and browser extensions that blocked distracting web sites.

### Impressions of the course: 
I think you'd be hard pressed to find a course that teaches such a broad range of information security topics and yet goes deep into the weeds where appropriate and most helpful than the SEC401. The teaching was all extremely real-world as were the labs. The course has truly helped make me a better defender and has given me an excellent foundation to build upon.

### Test Day: 
When I sat down, I noted how many questions I had and how much time I had to answer them. There's a current max of 180 questions in 5 hours time. That's a massive window of time and it would have been hard to gauge how well I was doing time-wise as I went if I just viewed it as one big chunk. This was one of the few things I used the whiteboard to help with, I divided the time and questions in half, then in half again to show myself how many questions I should have completed when a quarter of my time was up and so on. I even further divided up the last quarter of time for the last ~ hour into ~15 minute chunks. This helped me to go at a healthy pace and I actually finished the exam with less than a minute left.

There was 15 minutes of break time. I pushed this off until I noticed that I was feeling fatigued and needed a break to perform my best.

My method was to read the question and answer it whether I was sure or not. If I was doing okay on time, had doubt on an answer, and felt that the topic was specific enough that I could locate the answer in an efficient amount of time, I'd try to look it up. It can be tempting to refer to the books to verify everything you're not sure on. I started the exam this way and quickly realized the err of that approach -- there just isn't enough time for doing it that way. I ended up with a good blend of just going with answers that I was 90%+ sure on and quickly looking up others to verify whatever my initial answer was. Normally my initial instinct was correct, but I definitely gained knowledge even on test day with some answers that my instinct was wrong on.
