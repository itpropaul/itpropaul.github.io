# Random Cybersecurity Tip of the Day
### CTRL+R is your friend on the command line!

In both Windows PowerShell and Linux BASH save yourself some time when you want to run a command that you've ran in the past by using CTRL+R. CTRL+R searches your command history and matches previous commands as soon as you start typing. Give it a try!

>Bonus Tip!
If you've typed a few letters and don't see the correct match continue hitting CTRL+R and it will iterate through the history of matches from what you've typed.
