### SANS Institute YouTube Channel = Quality Cybersecurity Education

I've checked out a lot of Cybersecurity learning platforms and looking back through all of the different sources of training I've gone through or reviewed, I realize that much of my quality education has come from free SANS resources, mainly their YouTube channel summit talks.

If you already know what you're passionate about check out the playlists and watch videos from summits that cover the topics you like such as DFIR, OSINT, etc. If you're interested in all of Cybersecurity, sample videos from different summits and find out which pique your interest the most.
