### Easy Button Detection for Recent Exchange Server Vulnerabilities

Unless you've been hiding under a rock, you've been seeing all kinds of stuff about the recent Exchange vulnerabilities (CVE-2021-26855, CVE-2021-26857, CVE-2021-26858, and CVE-2021-27065). I read Brian Krebs' latest article on the topic and in it came across checkmyowa.unit221b.com.

This website is a gem, in the same way that you can check your email accounts to see if they've been compromised on haveibeenpwned.com, you can do the same for your Exchange server there. In addition to signing up for an email to notify you that you've been compromised, you can also visit the site from your Exchange server itself and it'll show a pop-up if it's public IP address matches their list.

No, this isn't a sure fire way to know if your Exchange server has been compromised, but it's another helpful tool amongst many others that have been widely discussed. It's also a very low barrier of entry way to do so, which is why I wanted to amplify it for places that don't have dedicated security resources or are light on IT staff.
