Check out: [lolbas-project.github.io](lolbas-project.github.io) for a curated open source project of Microsoft-signed files that can be used maliciously.

You can filter by file name, type, and function of the file. Each entry gets a very practical and succinct writeup including Mitre ID's. Oddvar Moe is the primary maintainer and main contributor to the project. 

Thanks Oddvar and team for an awesome resource!
