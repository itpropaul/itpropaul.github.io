# Random Cybersecurity Tip of the Day
### Getting into Infosec

I was developing a DIY Cybersecurity University type of website and then I stumbled across James Smith's site: [https://dfirmadness.com/getting-into-infosec/the-five-pillars/](https://dfirmadness.com/getting-into-infosec/the-five-pillars/).

Do yourself a favor and check it out!

There's something there for everyone. Beginners and experienced folks alike.

>UPDATE 12/17/2020 - I'm going to create the DIY Cybersecurity University page here on this site after all. Stay tuned! With that said, definitely still check out James Smith's site above.
